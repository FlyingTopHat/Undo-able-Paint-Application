Undo-able Paint Application
===========================
This project is a example of the [Command pattern][1] being used to implement undo functionality in a simple JavaScript Paint Application. It was created to accompany [my blog article][2] on the subject.

Generating documentation
------------------------
To generate the project's documentation download [JSDoc 3][3], and then execute the following (being sure to modify the paths where necessary).

    ./jsdoc/jsdoc.cmd -r "./Undo-able-Paint-Application/src/" -d "./Undo-able-Paint-Application/docs"
